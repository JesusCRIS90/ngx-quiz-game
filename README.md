# 🧠 Quiz Game - Angular Version
Welcome to my Quiz Game, a fun and interactive trivia game built with Angular! 🎉
<br>
This is is re-make version from previous version built on React

## ✨ About the Project
This project was created as a way to improve my knowledge of Angular and TypeScript asl well as a project to test custom libraries, focusing on component-based UI design, state management, and API integration. The game fetches trivia questions dynamically using the Open Trivia DB API, allowing for a variety of topics and difficulty levels.

Beyond being just a landing page, this project has served as a testing ground for several experiments:  
* 🔄 **Framework Porting**: Originally made with React, now completely reimplemented with Angular.  
* 📦 **Custom Libraries (@beexy)**: A way to test my own libraries in more realistic, production-like scenarios. *(More news soon!)*  
* ⚙️ **Automation & Deployment**: Includes an experimental **bash script (deploy.sh)** to automate the deployment process toward github-pages.  

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Fetches random/custom quiz questions from Open Trivia DB
* ✅ Multiple-choice/True-False questions with real-time feedback
* ✅ Score tracking system
* ✅ Clean and responsive UI with Angular
